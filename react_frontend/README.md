## The front-end part of the project.

This was creted as a react js project using vite.

##### This uses React JS as a framework.

As this is an MVP. i didin't put much work into the fron-end (but this can change simetime in the near future).
#### As for the styling and the react project archeticture it's sinmple and goes s follows:
    -> the componenets can be found iin './src/componenets/*.jsx'
      we have one file in './src/scripts/system_status.jsx' (this in the only model that isn't inside the componenets folder. 
      and it determins the status of the api endpoint).
    -> for styling we used normal css styling. and the files can be found in '.src/styling/*'
    -> project assets an be found inside '.src/assets/*'
