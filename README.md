#### Movie Recommendation system (preciseMovieStream)

##### system initial description:
      -> this system is retreiving movies info from an external API end point.
      -> asks the user a bunch of quations to determin the best movie for them.
      -> then the system RETURNS a list of the recomanded movies for the USER to watch.
      -> there is a chance for this system to be a streaming service, that get's to know the user better
      	 and sudggest a more fun and related experiance based on the user's watching habit (something near to Netflix algorithm).
#### the first features of this system would be basic. but then after, this system would be enhanced to provide a more rubust experiance.

#### this system will contain a user registration logic:
     the user will have to create an account to use the system (the reason for this is analytical and to enhance the system + wach user will be linked to it's own data so this will help the system figure out the next fun thing).

more functionality and description yet to come.
